🚀 Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict sales based on advertising spending across different channels.
The notebook includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizations

Feature Engineering

Linear Regression Model

Model Evaluation (R², RMSE, MAE)

Final Sales Predictions

Everything is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
